# Visualizing Covid-19 data with D3.JS

I have been thinking about starting a D3 project for a while now and this pandemic has finally given me the opportunity to try it out. So far I have tried out the map features but I will soon start adding other visuazlizations as well.

Currently I am only doing the visualizations for Bangladesh since the data is smaller that way and it's easy to debug, but as a result you will see that the geojson data is also not as accurate and even the Coronavirus case numbers aren't AS accurate as it is in the other parts of the world. Hopefully I will do the US based one soon which will let me do more visualizations than from the Bangladesh data.
